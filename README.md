# Incident-Response-Script-for-Web-Attacks
triage.sh is a CLI tool for web security triage, analyzing Apache/Nginx logs to detect SQLi, XSS, command injection, file inclusion, open redirects, scans, auth failures, and abnormal 404s. It flags suspicious payloads, encodings, and high-entropy strings, summarizes top IPs, and outputs a safe, timestamped report in /tmp for quick investigation.
